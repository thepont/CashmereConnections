##How to Consign Fibre

_It is important to consign fibre as soon possible to avoid the risk of contamination by moths and other pests._

If the clip is going to be consigned within 12 months, saddles may be packaged in light weight bin liners. Skirtings (belly, chest, legs) may be placed in a light weight bin liner or freezer bag. It is helpful if the bag containing the skirtings is then placed inside the same bag as the saddle. If you intend to press the fleeces, fold the opening over and place the bag in wool pack with fold down. If the bag is placed directly into a wool pack which is to be pressed, there is no need to tie the bag.

###Materials needed

Wool bales and bale clips are available from rural merchandising stores such as Landmark, CRT and Elders. Plastic bin liners / garbage bags are available for your local supermarket. Select a bin liner size that will confortably hold your fleeces. A light grade is acceptable.
How to prepare and consign your clip.

1. Skirt Fleece (belly, chest, legs). Put skirtings into one garbage bag and the saddle into another as described above. There is no need to label each bag.
2. Consolidate your clip into a nylon wool pack.
3. Cashmere connections will pay for the transport of the bales using Spargo transport, if the bale weight is greater than 75kg, if you want free transport, check that your bale weight is greater than 75Kg.
Click on the form button (on the left hand side of this page), download the consignment note and the form used to give personnel at Cashmere Connections the information we need to generate a recipient generated tax invoice (RTIA).
4. Print out three copies of the consignment note, and one copy of the RTIA. If you are NOT registered for GST "the government" requires you to fill out a "Statement by Supplier Form" (click the form button to the left and print one out). If you can't print these forms please contact: trishesson@bigpond.com for the forms to be sent to you.
5. Fill in three copies of the consignment notes, or one copy and photcopy twice.
6. Fill in the RTIA and if required the Statement by Supplier.
7. Put a copy of the consignment note in a plastic bag and place it in last bale closed. Please mark on the outside of this wool pack that this is where the consignment note can be found. Note on the other two copies of the consignment note in which outer (wool pack) you have placed the consignment note shipped with the fibre.
8. Keep the third copy of the Consignment Note for your own records.
9. Using a large black texta write Cashmere Connection's transport address on each bale.

   Cashmere Connections,  
	4 Osborne Street,  
	Bacchus Marsh,  
	Victoria, 3340.  

10. Write your address and phone number on the bale/bales.
11. Write the bale number and number of bales in the consignment on each bale; eg. bale 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3.
12. Consult the list of Australia wide transport depots to locate the depot closest to you.
13. Contact Catherine (who is in charge of Logistics at Graeme Spargo Transport) to have your clip booked in for transport.

	Email:	sales@spargotransport.com.au

14. Once you have booking confirmation you should contact your local transport depot to arrange a suitable drop off time.
15. Deliver your consignment to the transport depot.
16. Post a copy of your consignment note to Cashmere Connections. If you have not already supplied us with a RTIA you will need to download and complete this form also. Include this with your postal consignment note.

###Joint Consignment

Each grower needs to fill out their own consignment notes (three copies), recipient created invoice agreement, and if GST circumstances require, a copy of the government's "Statement by Supplier" form.

Place the fleeces from one grower in a woolpack; place on top a copy of the grower's consignment note (in a plastic bag); add a layer of newspaper and start the next grower's consignment. Don't split the material described by a consignment note across multiple wool packs. If a grower's consignment has to be split across multiple woolpacks, fill in multiple consignment notes, one for the fibre in each bale.

When labelling the bales for transport, treat the joint consignment as one. For example, if there are three bales, label the bales; 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3. The grower who looks after delivery should have their name and number on the bale as the sender, and should inform Spargo Transport of the delivery.

Please write on the bale: Joint Consignment, and a list of who owns the fleeces packed in the bale.
