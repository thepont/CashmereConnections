#Depots

If the bale weights more than 75kg, Cashmere Connections will pay for the transportation of fibre from designated transport depots.

Spargo Transport handle Cashmere Connections' transport logistics. Spargo Transport accept delivery at the transport depots listed below. Please book the consignment in with Graeme Spargo Transport by phone, fax or email before dropping the goods off, otherwise the goods may sit for a while. Remember to send a copy of your consignment note to Cashmere Connections by mail, fax or email.

If delivering your fleeces to Cashmere Connections directly please make sure also deliver your completed documentation. That is your consignment note, your RTIA agreement and a Statement By Supplier form if you are NOT registered for GST. This paperwork is available for down load from this website under forms in both the Alpaca and Cashmere sections of the website. It's very difficult to pay for fibre if we don't know who owns it.

Cashmere Connections is charged per delivered bale. Please put as much fibre as possible in each pack. The minimum bale size accepted is 75kg. The cost of bales weighing less than 75kg will be be worn by the producer.

Consignments above 80kg will have to be pressed. Joint consignments are discussed on the Alpaca page and are encouraged for lots less than 100kg. Pressed bales that weigh more than 100kg are preferred as they are easier to handle and transport. All consignments must be in nylon wool packs.

Remember to address each bale and to write on each bale your name, phone number, bale number and the total number of bales in the consignment. The consignment address is:

Cashmere Connections,  
4 Osborne Street (GST),
